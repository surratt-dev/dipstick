# Engineering Health Check

## TL;DR

The Engineering Health Check is a recurring retrospective ritual for engineers, focusing on the process of developing and maintaining application code. It is part of deliberate engineering communication practices. This framework is adaptable - teams should modify the process, scope, prompts, and frequency as needed. The highlights are:

- A recurring retrospective held by engineers on a  team about the process of developing and maintaining the application code
- Sessions are brief to minimize impact to the team's delivery cadence
- Facilitated by a senior engineer who can leverage their experience to help with the discussion and work through potential issues
- Team health is captured as metrics through votes on subjective topics, tracked over time
- Topics are discussed briefly if there are outliers in the vote or the vote represents a significant change to the trend

## What

The Engineering Health Check is a retrospective focused on the development experience and the code base for your applications. It's not a review of your test coverage or static analysis metrics, but rather about the engineer's satisfaction with the code base as a whole. An uninvested facilitator walks the engineersteam through a set of questions where each participant hand votes, typically on a scale of 1 to 4, sometimes using Roman voting (thumbs up/ thumbs down). The facilitator captures the results in a spreadsheet each session so trends can be identified. The facilitator will also note outliers in the vote and prompt brief discussion on the topic. The trends or conversations may result in takeaways for the team to address.

## Why

You can't have an objective conversation about traffic while sitting in stop-and-go traffic. Similarly, the magnitude of your satisfaction or frustration with coding may not be apparent while looking at your IDE. The act of separating ourselves from the keyboard and the facilitated prompts helps engineers think about the code objectively.

If you're frustrated about how hard it is to develop, maintain, or enhance your code, you might think about it during your commute or while at home. It would be much better to discuss this as a team, so other engineers understand your position and can potentially help. Doing it as a team encourages discussion and helps establish understanding and consensus.

## Who

All engineers on the product team should participate. The team should decide in advance what to do if someone cannot attend and what represents a quorum. Effort should be made to keep a regular cadence, so if a meeting cannot be held because of an absence, consider rescheduling the session as soon as possible to stay close to the schedule.

The session is led by a facilitator who guides the team through the discussion. The facilitator should be another engineer, preferably in a senior role so they can understand the technical topics which might be discussed and possess a broad set of experiences to draw on. They need to be from another team so that all engineers on the team can fully participate in the session.

The ritual should feel like a conversation amongst equals, so avoid having engineering managers as facilitators, especially when that manager is in the team's reporting structure. The facilitator must be empathetic and someone who can listen without interjecting their own opinions. The facilitator is responsible for helping the team identify and discuss possible issues; they are not responsible for solving problems. If a significant conflict is raised, the team needs to work with its engineering manager to resolve those issues.

> **Important Note:** The use of the term "senior engineer" for the facilitator is more about experience than title. The ability and desire to help is more important than what it says on your email footer.

## When

A typical cadence is meeting every two weeks, though teams should choose a frequency that fits their needs. Teams can also change the frequency as the tempo of effort changes. As effort intensifies, consider holding the conversation more often. This may help recognize the impact of external pressures on engineering practices.

## How Long

The intent is to keep the ceremony brief. Shoot for 30 minutes to start. Once the team becomes more proficient, the ceremony should take less time. This is time to discuss the state of the engineering team. It is not a time for bikeshedding. Be mindful that the engineers in this conversation are not writing code. This conversation is about identifying problems, not solving them.

## Where

The focus of the conversation is a set of questions (prompts) and the team's voting tracked over time, captured in a spreadsheet. It is best if the team can see this spreadsheet during the conversation, so a conference room with some type of video display is ideal.

## How

The facilitator walks the team through each prompt in the spreadsheet and the type of vote. For each prompt, participants use a four-finger vote or Roman vote, depending on the topic. Each participant should take a few seconds to consider the topic, then extends a closed fist to indicate they are ready to vote. Once everyone is ready, the facilitator counts for everyone to cast their vote (something like "1-2-3-shoot"). The participants all display their vote.

The finger vote is 1-4 so there is no middle ground. Each answer must be "more good than bad" or "more bad than good". The Roman votes are almost always thumbs up or down; only one topic allows for a "sideways" thumb vote.

The facilitator captures the results in the spreadsheet, taking an average of the finger votes or a tally of the Roman votes. The facilitator will note any outliers in the vote and then prompt those engineers to briefly describe their position. The rest of the team should listen and, if appropriate, ask clarifying questions. There should not be any "Yes, but here's why you're wrong..." type responses.

Issues may be identified during these sessions, but the team shouldn't try to resolve them at this time. To keep the conversation brief, if a possible issue is identified then a senior engineer on the team should take it as an action item to address at a later time.

## Topics

This table documents a possible set of topics to discuss during the health check. It's just a starting point. Each team should review the list, decide which topics are important to them, and make sure they all agree on what it means to them.

### Developing and Changing Code

| Topic | Voting | Prompts |
|-------|--------|---------|
| How easy is it to add features to production code? | Finger votes (1-4) | • Do you know where to find the code for a feature<br>• Do you think changing existing code is hard |
| How easy is it to reason about production code? | Finger votes (1-4) | • Do you understand the functionality<br>• Do you know which pieces interoperate and how<br>• Do you understand the libraries used and how |
| How would you rate the code under active development? | Finger votes (1-4) | • Do you feel rushed<br>• Are you making the code better |
| How would you rate the code for the entirety of the project? | Finger votes (1-4) | • Are you happy with the code<br>• Are there things you want to clean up |

## Additional Notes

- The set of topics can be added, removed, or tweaked to better benefit the team.  
Build into your cadence time review the set questions and determine if they are still valuable, are there subjects to be discussed
- Consider tracking action items across sessions to make sure they are carried out, discuss if they are effective, and having a positive impact on the engineers
- Make your first session an hour long to familiarize yourselves with the topics and process
- If possible, use a room which is appropriate to the size of the team; it should be cozy not cavernous. A large room would give the participants space to spread out and make it easier for defensive posturing

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does this apply to all your code, legacy and greenfield?**

A: It's up to each team to consider and decide. Some teams which have adopted the practice decided to restrict to greenfield code. It may depend on the amount of time you spend working in legacy code.

**Q: Who can facilitate these sessions?**

A: Any senior engineer could facilitate, so long as they are able to actively listen and make sure that all members in the group have the opportunity to be heard. It's probably best if they have been through the process a few times themselves.

**Q: Does the same person always need to facilitate for your teams?**

A: No. Anyone who is willing to facilitate should be able to do it. Having different facilitators can bring fresh perspectives to the sessions.
